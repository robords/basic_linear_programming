    "Formulate the linear program to meet these requirements.  Because the constraint matrix is square, this problem may be solved by inverting the constraint matrix (if invertible) and multiplying it by the right-hand side parameters.  See if you can do it.  Otherwise, solve the problem by using LPSolve, R, GAMS, or Python.  Provide the objective as well as all the decision variable values. "
